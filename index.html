          <h3>Severe learning disabilities</h3>
          <p>Approximately 2.4&nbsp;million students have specific learning disabilities and over 90% are not proficient in reading or math.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <i class="fas fa-school"></i>
          <h3>Teacher shortage</h3>
          <p>86% of U.S. schools report difficulty hiring teachers; 71% of elementary vacancies and 70% of special‑ed roles remain unfilled.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <i class="fas fa-book-open"></i>
          <h3>Low literacy levels</h3>
          <p>Only 32% of fourth graders read at a proficient level, while 39% fall below the basic benchmark.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>
          <h3>Unaffordable tutoring</h3>
          <p>Private reading tutors cost anywhere from $10 to $165+ per hour, putting intensive intervention out of reach for many families.</p>

      <h2>Why Multisensory?</h2>
      <div class="two-columns">
        <div class="text">
          <p>Students with severe dyslexia or other learning disabilities often require <em>hundreds</em> of <strong>correct repetitions</strong> of a skill to form new neural pathways. Repetition done correctly creates changes at the synaptic level, strengthening the connections between neurons so that reading becomes automatic. The number of repetitions needed increases dramatically for struggling readers &mdash; while a typical student may need 4–14 exposures, a student with dyslexia may need 40–200 repetitions to master the same skill. These drills are most effective when they are multisensory: they must involve sight, sound and movement together. Because tablets and computers lack the ability to capture and guide gross motor and tactile actions, current reading apps cannot facilitate the precise, kinesthetic drills that reading specialists deliver, leaving the most affected students underserved.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Exact repetition &amp; kinesthetic drills:</strong> reading specialists deliver structured drills that must be repeated with precision. These drills engage the whole body &mdash; tracing letters, tapping out phonemes and forming words with manipulatives &mdash; and cannot be fully replicated on a flat touchscreen.</li>
            <li><strong>Sky writing:</strong> students draw letters in the air using gross motor movements. Holding the arm straight and tracing large letters links sound and muscle memory, creating pathways in the brain.</li>
            <li><strong>Tactile surfaces:</strong> tracing letters or words in sand, rice, felt or velvet while saying the sounds aloud builds kinesthetic memory and engages touch.</li>
            <li><strong>Whole‑body movement:</strong> hopping out syllables or gesturing tricky sounds gets students moving and keeps attention focused. When children are taught using all three pathways to the brain, retention increases and learning becomes more enjoyable.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>LetterDojo harnesses virtual reality to deliver multisensory reading instruction to the students who need it most. Unlike tablet‑based programs, which can only show pictures and audio, our VR environment allows students to <strong>physically</strong> practice skills with guidance: tracing letters, performing sky writing, manipulating phonemes and building words in 3D space. Certified reading specialists can design drills that repeat exactly, ensuring that each repetition strengthens neural pathways. Data‑driven analytics give teachers and parents insights into progress and adapt instruction in real time.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Immersive VR environment engages learners and sustains attention.</li>
